## Description

Have you ever wanted to keep a track of your finances? Make a list of your expenditures? See how much everything is costing you, but don't want to bother with the hassle of making an Excel file and all those pesky SUM() commands? Then this is the perfect option for you. You can do all that hear with an intuitive and simple UI.

## How to use

There is a form you can use to submit an expenditure with a description of it and the amount. You select the group that the expenditure belongs to (or if you don't care, leave it with Other). You can add your own groups for better organization as well. 

Don't worry, you can also edit the description and amount after adding them to the group. Simply select their text boxes and edit to your hearts content. 

Don't want a group anymore and it's expenditures? There is a delete button to get rid of the group as well! The group to be deleted gets highlighted so you know for sure what you're deleting. 

Don't want an expenditure anymore? There's a delete button for that too that pops up when you're in the row for that expenditure. It gets highlighted when hovering over the delete button so you once again know for sure what you're deleting.

## TODO

Some features to be added:

-Be able to drag and drop to rearrange group orders
-Use localStorage features to prevent data being deleted after closing the browser or by reloading it
-Create a download button so that you can import it afterwards and have all your information pop back in
